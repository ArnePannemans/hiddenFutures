  "description": "This is a fun 'art' project built together with my dad. The main functionality is a UI that allows users to play and experiment with converting really big numbers into images and vice versa. The idea is that every image you can imagine—whether it's a picture of how you'll look when you're 80, the view from the top of Mount Everest, or the winning lottery numbers for next week—exists somewhere within a grid of pixels, each associated with a unique number. You can start from a randomly generated number, choose a number yourself, or upload an image.",
