# Project

"This is a fun 'art' project built together with my dad. The main functionality is a UI that allows users to play and experiment with converting really big numbers into images and vice versa. The idea is that every image you can imagine—whether it's a picture of how you'll look when you're 80, the view from the top of Mount Everest, or the winning lottery numbers for next week—exists somewhere within a grid of pixels, each associated with a unique number. You can start from a randomly generated number, choose a number yourself, or upload an image.

The underlying philosophy is that all images exist somewhere within this grid and can be retrieved with the right number, if only we had the right number... However, in practice, almost all numbers will generate meaningless noise due to the random configuration of pixels (insert interesting link with entropy). But that's part of the fun! Press the "Feeling Lucky?" button to test your luck and see if you can generate something interesting. Who knows, you might stumble upon an image of next week's lottery numbers or a hidden masterpiece!

On the flip side, you can also upload an image and retrieve its magic number. Imagine finding the unique number that represents your favorite photo!
